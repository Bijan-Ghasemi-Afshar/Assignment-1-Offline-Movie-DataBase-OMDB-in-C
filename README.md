Aim: The aim of this assignment is for the student to gain experience in the design and implementation of a simple application in the C programming language.
This will involve use of most of the basic language constructs, such as types, expressions, selection, repetition, functions etc. 
(which are broadly similar to Java) but will also involve more advanced topics including the use of pointers and dynamic memory allocation 
(which are rather different) and the use of structs to write modular programs based on abstract data types (the forerunners of classes).
